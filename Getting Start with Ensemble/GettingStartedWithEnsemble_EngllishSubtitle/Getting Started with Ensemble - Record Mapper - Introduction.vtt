00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the eLearning
session Getting

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.025 align:middle line:84%
Started With Ensemble: Record
Mapper - An Introduction.

00:00:07.025 --> 00:00:10.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.330 align:middle line:84%
The Record Mapper is
a graphical interface

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.200 align:middle line:84%
accessed from the
Ensemble Management portal

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.720 align:middle line:84%
to define flat file
structure to bring data

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.520 align:middle line:90%
into or out of Ensemble.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.570 align:middle line:84%
The flat file can either
have delimited or fixed

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.980 align:middle line:90%
width fields.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.850 align:middle line:84%
The need for custom
code is eliminated

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.850 align:middle line:84%
and all classes are
automatically created.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:84%
These classes can then be
used with pre-built Ensemble

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Business Services or
Business Operations.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Once the record has been brought
into Ensemble via record mapper

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.930 align:middle line:84%
class, it becomes
an Ensemble Message

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:84%
and can be processed
like any other Message.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:90%


00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.300 align:middle line:84%
The graphical
interface allows you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
to define the delimiters that
are used in the flat file

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.130 align:middle line:84%
to separate fields
and terminate records.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:84%
It is recommended that you open
a sample file in the Record

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.220 align:middle line:84%
Mapper while
defining the fields.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.085 align:middle line:84%
This way, you can
immediately see any errors.

00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:09.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at an example
of an existing Record Mapper

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:90%
definition.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.900 align:middle line:84%
You can see that we have
given this record map

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:84%
a name--
DemoRecordMap.Map.Delimited--

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.980 align:middle line:90%
along with a Target Class.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:84%
While this Record Map
definition is delimited,

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.950 align:middle line:84%
we have the option of
defining fixed width as well.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.880 align:middle line:84%
We define our record terminator
character and the separators

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:90%
that are used in the file.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
Once this is defined, we
can then define each field

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.610 align:middle line:84%
in the delimited file
in the correct order

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
so that we can extract
the appropriate data when

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:84%
this Record Map definition
is used in Ensemble.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:84%
As an example,
the field PersonID

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:90%
we've defined as an integer.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
it is the first field.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.190 align:middle line:90%
The second field is Age.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.630 align:middle line:90%
That is also an integer.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.730 align:middle line:84%
The sample data will
reflect the field

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.515 align:middle line:90%
once we save the definition.

00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:25.330 align:middle line:90%


00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how this
Record Mapper definition

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.160 align:middle line:84%
would be used in an actual
Ensemble Production.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have a Production that
will make use of the mapper.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have a Production that
makes use of the Record Mapper

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.580 align:middle line:90%
we were just looking at.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.860 align:middle line:84%
If we take a look at
the Business Service,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Delimted.RecordMap.FileService,
we

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.340 align:middle line:84%
can see that the class
that is used for this

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:84%
is a pre-built
Ensemble component.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're using a
standard adapter class

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.580 align:middle line:90%
for a file inbound adaptor.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Since it is a file
inbound adapter,

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.290 align:middle line:84%
we need to define the file
location and the File Spec

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.900 align:middle line:84%
for the flat files in
the operating system that

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
will be pulled into Ensemble
for this Business Service.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:84%
We've also defined
an archive directory.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.090 align:middle line:84%
We can also see that
this Business Service

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.033 align:middle line:84%
will be sending its message to
the two Business Operations.

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:84%
And we've defined the
Record Mapper definition

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.880 align:middle line:84%
that we were just looking at
as the record map that will be

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.300 align:middle line:90%
used for this Business Service.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.310 align:middle line:84%
If we take a look at
the Business Operation,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:84%
we can see that we have
similar information here.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.310 align:middle line:84%
We are using a standard
pre-built Ensemble

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.019 align:middle line:84%
component for record
mapper file operations.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And we have defined
our output path

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:84%
and the name of the file that
will be in the output path.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And we also have defined
the appropriate record

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:90%
map that will be used.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.990 align:middle line:90%
Let's see how this will be used.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.730 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
In the appropriate
directory, we're

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.670 align:middle line:84%
going to paste a file that
has the delimited information.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, it has
been picked up by Ensemble,

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.120 align:middle line:90%
has been processed.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And if we take a look
at the in archive,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:84%
we can see that it
has been archived.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we take a look
at the out directory,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
we can see that the
output has been put

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:90%
into the appropriate location.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.180 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to Ensemble so
that we could view the messages

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.530 align:middle line:90%
related to this Production.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And here we have the message
header, message body.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, each field that
we've defined in the record map

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.650 align:middle line:84%
is one of the field in
the body of our message.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And we also can see
the complete trace.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.390 align:middle line:84%
This was done without any
code using the Record Mapper

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.870 align:middle line:84%
and Ensemble
pre-built components.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Let's build a simple
new record map.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So in the Ensemble portal,
we will choose New.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
change the record map

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:08.650 align:middle line:90%
name to Scan.RecordMap.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:15.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:22.340 align:middle line:84%
We will also adjust
the target class name

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:32.640 align:middle line:90%
to Scan.EmployeeRequest.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
This will be a delimited file
with a carriage return line

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.250 align:middle line:90%
feed as the record separator.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to add a
colon as the field separator.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.450 align:middle line:84%
In order to help field
definition a little easier,

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.170 align:middle line:90%
let's bring in a sample file.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'll click on
Select Sample File.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.779 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to choose
SampleDataBusiness.txt.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:17.590 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, we have the
colon as the field separator.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:90%
And there are four fields.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.180 align:middle line:84%
We have a person's name
and ID and email address

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:90%
and some text.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:31.010 align:middle line:84%
By clicking on Add
a New Field, we

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.910 align:middle line:84%
will be able to put
our first field in.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.980 align:middle line:90%
The first field will be Name.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.500 align:middle line:90%
And it will be a string.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:55.805 align:middle line:84%
Adding a new field, this one
will be ID and is an integer.

00:07:55.805 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Our next field is going
to be the ToAddress, which

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.735 align:middle line:90%
is a string.

00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:18.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And our final one will
be the email text,

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.500 align:middle line:90%
which is also a string.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, once we save this, we
will see our sample data

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
displayed with the appropriate
fields as we have just defined.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And we can see that
everything is correct.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.430 align:middle line:84%
At this point, we're
going to generate

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:84%
all of the classes
for the record map.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And as we can see,
we have created

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:13.030 align:middle line:84%
two new classes,
one for the data

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:90%
and one for the request message.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:25.040 align:middle line:84%
This record map is now ready
for use in a Production.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Before we actually use
this in a Production,

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.810 align:middle line:84%
let's take a look at the classes
that were actually generated.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.016 align:middle line:90%
Here, we have the Record Map.

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And we can see the four
fields we have defined

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and the various
methods that are needed

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:90%
to do the maintenance for this.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:57.100 align:middle line:84%
We also have the EmployeeRequest
which uses the same four

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.720 align:middle line:90%
fields as properties.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.923 align:middle line:84%
This is the persistent
class for this message.

00:10:02.923 --> 00:10:05.830 align:middle line:90%


00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have an
Ensemble Production

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
that already has an
output Business Operation.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, we are using
a pre-built Ensemble component

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:84%
for the file operation and
using a standard file outbound

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:90%
adapter.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:84%
We have defined
our File Path where

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.310 align:middle line:84%
the data will be stored
in the operating system

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and we have defined the
use of Scan.RecordMap

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.390 align:middle line:84%
as the Record Map for
this Business Operation.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Let's add a new
Business Service.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:84%
This Business Service is going
to utilize the record map file

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:90%
service.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
call this EmailScan.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.365 align:middle line:90%
And it will be enabled.

00:11:13.365 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
Now let's add the appropriate
definitions that we

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.520 align:middle line:90%
need for this Business Service.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
The File Path where our
files will be located

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.100 align:middle line:84%
is the same that we
were using previously.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:84%
The File Spec is
specific for the one file

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.955 align:middle line:84%
that we wish to process, which
is SampleDataBusiness.txt.

00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:53.280 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.825 align:middle line:84%
The Archive Path will be the
same that we were using before.

00:11:56.825 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:10.600 align:middle line:84%
The Target Config is going to be
the output Business Operation.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And the Record Map
that we will use

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
is the one that we just
created-- Scan.RecordMap.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:32.830 align:middle line:84%
We will apply these settings,
start the Production,

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and put our file into
the appropriate directory

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.550 align:middle line:84%
for processing by
the Production.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:54.460 align:middle line:84%
As we look at the archive,
here's our archive file.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:13:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have our
output file as well.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:84%
We can also take a
look at the messages,

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:11.420 align:middle line:84%
as we should have some messages
that were processed here.

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.492 align:middle line:90%
And here's our trace.

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see,
the body of the message

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.730 align:middle line:84%
is that structure
that we've defined.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.725 align:middle line:84%
And this data should
be recognizable.

00:13:21.725 --> 00:13:26.210 align:middle line:90%


00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.140 align:middle line:84%
