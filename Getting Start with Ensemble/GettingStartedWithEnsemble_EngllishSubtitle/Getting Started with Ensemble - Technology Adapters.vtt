00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the eLearning session
Getting Started with Ensemble:

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.110 align:middle line:90%
Technology Adapters.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Business Services and
Business Operations

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.900 align:middle line:84%
provide the inbound and
outbound connection points

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle line:90%
for Ensemble Production.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.470 align:middle line:84%
While not always required, both
Business Services and Business

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Operations use adapters to
achieve this connection.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.230 align:middle line:84%
Business Services
use Inbound Adapters.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:84%
And Business Operations
use Outbound Adaptors.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.600 align:middle line:84%
An adapter is a class
that will handle

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.700 align:middle line:84%
the details of the
technology being

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.490 align:middle line:84%
used for the connection, such
as the wire protocol or file

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:84%
format, together with
retries and error handling.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200 align:middle line:84%
The Business
Operations and Services

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.630 align:middle line:84%
handle the content
at a higher level.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.150 align:middle line:84%
For a Business Service,
the Inbound Adapter

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.440 align:middle line:84%
is constantly looking
for work, for example,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.420 align:middle line:84%
by listening on a
TCP/IP connection port

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
or monitoring a
directory of files.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
When it finds work to do, it
calls the method ProcessInput

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:84%
of the Business Service, passing
the input as a first parameter.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And the Business Service
will pass back any response

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:84%
by reference in the
second parameter.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look in
Studio at an adapter class.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.220 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, there
are adapters to handle

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.330 align:middle line:84%
a wide range of technologies--
EDI, HL7, HTTP, SOAP SQL,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.820 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
As an example, let's look
at the File InboundAdapter

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that is used for picking
up operating system files

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.442 align:middle line:90%
and processing them.

00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:53.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Business
Service or Operation,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.500 align:middle line:90%
an adapter class has settings.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.850 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the
File InboundAdapter,

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
these include the File
Path, Working Directory,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.400 align:middle line:90%
and Archive Directory.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.440 align:middle line:84%
These are properties
of the adapter class.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Other adapters have settings
appropriate to the technology

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:90%
they handle.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
When you configure a Business
Service in a Production,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.420 align:middle line:84%
the adapter settings
will appear along

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:84%
with the other settings
of the Business Service.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.140 align:middle line:84%
If the Business Service
uses an adapter,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
one or more jobs will be started
when the Production is started

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.970 align:middle line:90%
to run the Business Service.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.120 align:middle line:84%
The number of jobs is controlled
by the Pool Size setting

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:90%
for the Business Service.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
When the file adapter is
running in a Business Service,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:84%
it will check the FilePath for
files that match the FileSpec.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
If there are any, it will
process them one by one.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.050 align:middle line:84%
It moves a file to
the work directory,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:84%
if that has been specified,
reads the file into a stream,

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.590 align:middle line:84%
and passes the stream
to the ProcessInput

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:90%
method of the Business Service.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Upon successful completion
of the Business Service,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
the file is moved to
the ArchiveDirectory,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.010 align:middle line:90%
if that has been specified.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.240 align:middle line:84%
If there are no
files to process,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.440 align:middle line:84%
the adapter will go to
sleep and check again

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
after the number of seconds
specified in the Call Interval

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.730 align:middle line:90%
setting.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.600 align:middle line:84%
To include this adapter
in a Business Service,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I can use the New
Business Service Wizard

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.085 align:middle line:84%
in Studio, which will
create a class like this.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.680 align:middle line:84%
By clicking on New and
selecting Business Service

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.730 align:middle line:84%
in my Production tab, I
can specify the Package,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.707 align:middle line:90%
the Business Service.

00:03:48.707 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
When I click Next, I
have the opportunity

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.620 align:middle line:84%
to select the
appropriate adapter.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.400 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.470 align:middle line:84%
When I click Finish,
you can see that I

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
have the basis of a new
Business Service class.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
The adapter parameter
has been specified

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:84%
as the file inbound adapter
that I've just selected.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, I need to implement the
OnProcessInput method in order

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
to process, line by line,
the information that

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.472 align:middle line:90%
was read into the input stream.

00:04:34.472 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Other Inbound Adapters, such as
the FTP adapter, email adapter,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
or SQL adapter behave
in much the same way,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
although the settings
available are different.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
The TCP and HTTP adapters
are slightly different

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and open a socket and listen for
input continually, rather than

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:90%
polling at intervals.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But the essential
use is the same.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Now we will look at
Outbound Adapters, which are

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:90%
called by Business Operations.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
In a Business Operation,
the property ADAPTER

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
holds an object reference
to the adapter object

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
so you can call methods or
set properties of the adapter.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Normally, the Outbound Adapter
exposes a few simple methods

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:84%
to make it easy to
call the adapter.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at an example
of a Business Operation

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:90%
using the SQL Outbound Adapter.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So we will open
Business Operations,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:90%
eLearning, SQLOperation.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
When using the Business
Operation Wizard,

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
you define the adapter to
be used for this Business

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Operation, and that value
becomes the ADAPTER property.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
That makes coding the
Business Operation much easier

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
since the adapter methods and
properties are now exposed

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:90%
to the Business Operation.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I can set properties
of the adapter.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
my OnInit method,

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I have set the timeout in
the Statement,Attrs property.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
The main properties
of each adapter

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
are exposed through
the configuration

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:90%
page of the Production.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So the values can be set either
in the configuration item,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
or they can be set in the
Business Operation code.

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
The MessageMap defines
the post-message method

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
for StringRequest messages
that are sent to this Business

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Operation.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
In this case, SQL
inserts the text content

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
of my StringRequest message
into one column and the time

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:90%
and date into another column.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:84%
The SQL Outbound
Adapter also has methods

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:90%
to execute queries and updates.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:84%
When working with
any adapter, you

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
will find the online class
reference in our documentation

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to be very useful for seeing
what methods and properties are

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:84%
If we take a look
at the configuration

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:84%
page of a Production, we can
add the SQL Business Operation

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to the Production, simply
selecting it from the list,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
giving it a name, making
sure it's enabled so that it

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.726 align:middle line:90%
can be used, and clicking OK.

00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
If we take a look
at this operation,

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:84%
you can see in the
Settings the adapter class

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:84%
that's being utilized, the class
for the Business Operation,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as information that
would be required for a SQL

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
connection, for example, the DSN
credentials, potentially JDBC

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.820 align:middle line:90%
driver information, as well.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for listening
to this session Getting

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Started with Ensemble:
Technology Adapters.
