00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.490 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the eLearning session
Getting Started with Ensemble,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Data Transformations.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.530 align:middle line:84%
When sending data from
one system to another,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.940 align:middle line:84%
it is common to have to map
data from one record or message

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.380 align:middle line:84%
structure to another that
is slightly different.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.540 align:middle line:84%
For example, an employee
record or object in one system

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.660 align:middle line:84%
will have the same
basic information

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.220 align:middle line:84%
as in another system,
but the fields

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
may be in a different order,
called different things,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.990 align:middle line:84%
and the content of some of the
fields may need to be changed.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.000 align:middle line:84%
Another example would be sending
an HL7 message, a protocol

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
which is widely
used in health care,

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.690 align:middle line:90%
from one application to another.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.770 align:middle line:84%
In this situation,
it is almost always

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:84%
necessary to modify
the message slightly

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.530 align:middle line:84%
to meet the requirements of
the receiving application.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.680 align:middle line:84%
In Ensemble, you can
map from one data format

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:84%
to another with a
Data Transformation.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Data Transformations
are simple in concept,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.200 align:middle line:84%
as they take the input
or source object,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.020 align:middle line:84%
and create an output
or target object.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.450 align:middle line:84%
In practice, they can be
as simple or as complex

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.070 align:middle line:90%
as a task requires.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.100 align:middle line:84%
In an Ensemble production,
Data Transformations

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.170 align:middle line:84%
are typically used as a
Business Process activity.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.340 align:middle line:84%
Data transformations can be
written in CachÃ© Object Script.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But they are nearly
always created

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.690 align:middle line:84%
using the graphical
Data Transformation

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Editor in the Ensemble
Management Portal or Studio.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
As you can see
here, the target SKU

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:84%
is just a different name
from the source SKUCode.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.740 align:middle line:84%
However, the target
Quantity is actually

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.630 align:middle line:84%
a calculation subtracting
NumberOutstanding

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.650 align:middle line:90%
from the NumberOrdered.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
a simple example

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.150 align:middle line:84%
where we will transform a simple
employee format, Employee1,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
to a slightly different
format, Employee2.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:84%
In the Ensemble
Management Portal,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
we will go to Build,
Data Transformations,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.830 align:middle line:90%
and we will select New.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:84%
We will keep our new
Data Transformation

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.806 align:middle line:84%
in the eLearning package, but
we will call this EmployeeDTL.

00:02:23.806 --> 00:02:28.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Choosing our source
class, we will

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:84%
select all non-system
classes, because we

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.272 align:middle line:84%
are using a persistent object
found in the eLearning package

00:02:41.272 --> 00:02:42.105 align:middle line:90%
and it is Employee1.

00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.595 align:middle line:84%
The target object is
going to be Employee2.

00:02:53.595 --> 00:03:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.170 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, our
Source, Employee1,

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.200 align:middle line:84%
is on the left-hand side,
and our Target, Employee2,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.840 align:middle line:90%
is on the right-hand side.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
that the structure

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.280 align:middle line:84%
is slightly different,
but still contains

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.795 align:middle line:90%
the same type of information.

00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.430 align:middle line:84%
The right-hand panel
contains several tabs.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
The Action tab will
contain the action

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:90%
that we're currently working on.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.350 align:middle line:84%
The Tools tab has a Test
button, where we can actually

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:90%
test our Data Transformation.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And the Transform tab
has some initial settings

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:90%
that we can use.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.910 align:middle line:84%
One of the settings
is the Create setting.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
there are several options.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:84%
The Copy option for Create will
make a duplicate of the source

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:90%
to become the target.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.560 align:middle line:84%
The two structures
must be identical.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.040 align:middle line:84%
That is not the case here,
so we will start with a brand

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:90%
new object for our target.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.570 align:middle line:84%
The bottom panel
contains each action

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
as we set it transforming
Employee1 to Employee2.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
These actions are
performed in the order

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
that you see them in
this bottom panel.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
To add an action, I can
simply drag and drop.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with
the FirstName, which

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.800 align:middle line:90%
is the GivenName in the target.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
By dragging FirstName
to GivenName,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
you can see that the action has
been added to the bottom panel.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.715 align:middle line:84%
I will do the same for
LastName and Department.

00:05:09.715 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that they are
in the bottom panel in the order

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:90%
in which I chose them.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I can change the order
by highlighting an action

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and clicking on the
up or down arrow.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I can also delete an action
by clicking on the red X.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:84%
There is also an Actions
pull-down menu that give us

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:90%
additional functionality.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if I choose
Department and add an "if"

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:12.180 align:middle line:84%
action, my condition will be if
my source Department equals HQ,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:90%
I need to take an action.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And the action that
I will take will

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:36.611 align:middle line:84%
be to set the Target Department
equal to the literal value

00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:37.110 align:middle line:90%
"Central".

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Now in this
situation, we've only

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:49.320 align:middle line:84%
accounted for the source
Department being HQ.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
Other options would
have to be taken care

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:84%
of in the "else" clause
or in another way.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
Now that we've made
some actions, let's test

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:90%
what we have done.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
First we need to compile
our Data Transformation.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:15.420 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Once we've compiled, we go to
the Tools tab and choose Test.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.040 align:middle line:84%
For document formats
such as HL7, X12,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.260 align:middle line:84%
or XML virtual documents, I
can simply paste the document

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.480 align:middle line:90%
into the Input Message box.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.230 align:middle line:84%
For a class structure,
like Employee1

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.390 align:middle line:84%
I have to enter the XML
representation of the source.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:84%
This means I can only use the
Test utility where the classes

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:84%
or any classes reference
extend %XML.Adaptor.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Here I have a simple
example that I've

00:07:54.780 --> 00:08:01.140 align:middle line:84%
pasted so we can see the
results by clicking Test.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And you will notice that
our First and Last Name

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.320 align:middle line:90%
are unchanged.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.870 align:middle line:84%
However, Department
which is HQ in the source

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:90%
is now Central in the target.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:22.660 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Behind the graphical
interface, the Transformation

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.210 align:middle line:84%
is created as a class with all
the actions in an XML block.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.914 align:middle line:84%
We will take a
look at this later.

00:08:34.914 --> 00:08:36.539 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at
a few other things

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:40.289 align:middle line:84%
we can do in Data
Transformations.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:45.700 align:middle line:84%
A set action can be modified
with certain functions.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:51.320 align:middle line:84%
If we choose LastName, we
can modify the set action

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:90%
with a function.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:59.910 align:middle line:90%


00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.150 align:middle line:84%
As we take a look
at the Functions,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
you can see that there are
a large number of Functions

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:90%
that we can choose from.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Some are used in
conditional expressions,

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:84%
and others are used to change
the actual target value.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.950 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we're
going to modify

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:28.380 align:middle line:84%
the LastName to be all uppercase
by using a ToUpper function.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:84%
When we click OK,
you can see that we

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:90%
have modified the set action.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's test this.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:46.165 align:middle line:84%
We will compile, go back
to our Tools, choose Test.

00:09:46.165 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see, now the
LastName or the FamilyName

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:90%
is now all uppercase.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.980 align:middle line:90%


00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.670 align:middle line:84%
One important
function is Lookup.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.830 align:middle line:84%
This allows you to map
values using a lookup table.

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I had
many Department names that

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
were coded separately in the
source and target records,

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
I could use a lookup table
to convert HQ to Central

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Repeating fields in
the source or target

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
are indicated by
parentheses, as we

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
can see here with the Projects
property of our source.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
If you drag the
repeating source projects

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.240 align:middle line:84%
to the single-value
target Projects,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:84%
it would keep overriding
the target value.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But I can modify
that value, adding

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:90%
a separator between each value.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:59.600 align:middle line:84%
This is done with
a foreach action.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
So I will highlight
Projects, choose foreach.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:84%
I will add a set
action to my foreach

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:32.510 align:middle line:84%
by setting Target.Projects
will become a delimited string,

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
where each project in
our list in our source

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.760 align:middle line:84%
will be separated
by a delimiter.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:12:00.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:11.220 align:middle line:84%
We will compile and then,
using our Tools tab,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:90%
test our transformation.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:84%
This example now has
multiple projects

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:84%
so that when we click Test, we
can see that each project is

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:90%
separated by a delimiter.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a look at the Data
Transformation in Studio.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:43.320 align:middle line:84%
So we go to Data
Transformations, eLearning,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
and here is our EmployeeDTL
Data Transformation.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:90%


00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:84%
When we take a look at the
Data Transformation in Studio,

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.190 align:middle line:84%
you can see that we have the
same graphical editor that we

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.230 align:middle line:84%
were working with in the
Ensemble Management portal.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:10.360 align:middle line:84%
However, by clicking
on View Other Code,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.930 align:middle line:84%
we can see the
XML representation

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.360 align:middle line:90%
of our Data Transformation.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And here you can see each
transformation in the order

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:90%
that it will be executed.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.000 align:middle line:84%
