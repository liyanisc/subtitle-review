00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the eLearning session
Getting Started with Ensemble,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.070 align:middle line:90%
The Basic Components.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.540 align:middle line:84%
This session will describe
the basic building blocks

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.970 align:middle line:84%
of an Ensemble solution
and the basic tools

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:84%
that you will use to
build and manage it.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Ensemble is designed
to connect applications

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.995 align:middle line:84%
using a wide variety of
technologies and protocols.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:84%
An Ensemble solution is
known as a Production.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.570 align:middle line:84%
An Ensemble Production
defines all the components

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that handle inbound and
outbound connections,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.740 align:middle line:84%
and control the flow of
information between them.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.530 align:middle line:84%
The Production is created
once and configuration items

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:84%
are added to complete
the solution.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:84%
The inbound connection points
are known as Business Services,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.760 align:middle line:84%
while the outbound
connection points are

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.610 align:middle line:90%
known as Business Operations.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.410 align:middle line:84%
These handle the technology
used for connection,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:10.650 align:middle line:84%
such as TCP/IP, flat files,
SOAP, FTP, HTTP, and so forth.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.100 align:middle line:84%
Some formats, such as those
used in an HL7 Production,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.800 align:middle line:84%
are pre-built
components that just

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.090 align:middle line:84%
have to be configured with
the appropriate parameters,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:84%
such as the port number
for TCP/IP, or the path

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.130 align:middle line:90%
and file names for flat files.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.200 align:middle line:84%
For specific
applications, users may

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.510 align:middle line:84%
develop their own
Business Services

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:90%
or Business Operations.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Business Services and
Business Operations

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
often use adapters to handle
the specific technology

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and protocol used to
communicate with an application.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:84%
The Business Services
and Business Operations

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.070 align:middle line:84%
and their associated
adapters handle

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:84%
everything to do
with the connection,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:84%
such as initial connection,
retries, timeouts, and framing,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.310 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
actual wire protocol.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:84%
This is kept separate
from any business logic

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:84%
to orchestrate calls to
separate applications

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.640 align:middle line:84%
or to route a
transformer request.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
A Business Process is used
to implement this business

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:84%
logic that decides where an
incoming request should be sent

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.340 align:middle line:84%
or to orchestrate calls
to external applications

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.150 align:middle line:90%
to build a reply.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
At runtime, a Business
Process could send requests

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
to many Business Operations or
to other Business Processes.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:84%
These requests can
be asynchronous,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.790 align:middle line:84%
and a Business Process may
have to wait hours or even

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.220 align:middle line:90%
days for a response.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.150 align:middle line:84%
While waiting, the Business
Process is written to disk

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
and is only re-opened
when the response arrives.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.490 align:middle line:84%
A large Production may have
hundreds of these configuration

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.740 align:middle line:90%
items.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.370 align:middle line:84%
When a Production
is started, jobs

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
are started to run
all of the components.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Here you see a production
in the configuration

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
page of the Ensemble
Management portal.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Configuration items, such as
Business Services, Processes,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.670 align:middle line:84%
and Operations, communicate
by sending messages,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.070 align:middle line:84%
so a Business Service may send
a request message to a Business

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Process and get a
response message back.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.640 align:middle line:84%
You can see here that
the Business Service

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.420 align:middle line:84%
CompositeOrderService sends
a message to the Business

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Process, CompositeOrderProcess,
which in turn sends

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:84%
a message to the Business
Process RestockProcess

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.960 align:middle line:84%
and the Business Operations
Inventory, OrderProcessing,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.570 align:middle line:90%
and PriceList.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:84%
As you can imagine, messages
are an integral part

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:90%
of an Ensemble solution.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
Business Processes can be
written in custom code,

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.750 align:middle line:84%
but most either use a
routing engine together

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
with routing rules, or are
written in Business Process

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Language, or BPL.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Here you see a Business Process
in the Ensemble graphical BPL

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.060 align:middle line:90%
editor.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.709 align:middle line:84%
BPL is designed to
orchestrate calls

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.265 align:middle line:84%
to Business Operations and
other Business Processes.

00:04:23.265 --> 00:04:26.540 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.510 align:middle line:84%
Business rules allow
a business analyst

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.280 align:middle line:84%
to make changes to the
way a running Business

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Process behaves.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
The designer of the
Business Process

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
adds the call to
the rule and makes

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:84%
use of the values
returned by the rules

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:84%
to determine how the Business
Process will continue.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.380 align:middle line:84%
On a running system,
an analyst can then

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
modify the rules
without stopping

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:90%
the system or changing code.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Routing Rules are
a form of rule used

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:84%
by a special Business Process
known as a Message Router.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Here is an HL7 Routing
Rule implemented

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:90%
without programming.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.560 align:middle line:84%
When connecting systems, it
is very common to convert

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:84%
or map a message or record to a
similar but slightly different

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:90%
format.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.830 align:middle line:84%
In Ensemble, this is done
using Data Transformation.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Data Transformations are built
using our Data Transformation

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Language, or DTL.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:84%
The Ensemble Studio provides
a graphical drag-and-drop

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:84%
interface to make it easy
to develop Transformations.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.440 align:middle line:84%
The Ensemble tools are
accessed by clicking

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.420 align:middle line:84%
on the blue E in the system
tray of a Windows workstation,

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
allowing you to connect to
an Ensemble instance running

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
on your local PC
or a remote server.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:84%
Alternately, you can bookmark
the URL in your web browser.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The Ensemble
Management portal is

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.790 align:middle line:84%
used to manage and
configure the system

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.280 align:middle line:84%
and to develop some of the
components described here.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.380 align:middle line:84%
This includes configuration
and operations tasks

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.100 align:middle line:84%
that are common to
Ensemble and Cache,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
such as managing security, as
well as the Ensemble-specific

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.020 align:middle line:90%
management.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.580 align:middle line:84%
The Ensemble Management
portal allows

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.670 align:middle line:84%
you to configure a production,
look at the history

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.590 align:middle line:84%
or messages that have
passed through the system

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and any errors that
might have occurred.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.480 align:middle line:84%
You can also look at the
current state of the system,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.990 align:middle line:84%
including the status
of components,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
the length and
content of the queues,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.310 align:middle line:84%
and many other aspects
of the running system.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.760 align:middle line:84%
The Ensemble
Management portal also

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:84%
includes the graphical editors
to develop DTL, BPL, business

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.310 align:middle line:90%
rules, and record maps.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
The Ensemble Studio is used
for developing and maintaining

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.360 align:middle line:90%
new components in Ensemble.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.170 align:middle line:84%
Because Ensemble
is object-oriented,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.720 align:middle line:84%
almost everything you
develop will be a class.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.750 align:middle line:84%
In most cases you will create a
subclass of a standard Ensemble

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
class that provides most of
the functionality you need.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
For Ensemble classes
written in BPL or DTL,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
the Ensemble Studio
automatically

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
uses the appropriate
graphical editor.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for watching
Getting Started with Ensemble,

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.376 align:middle line:90%
The Basic Components.

00:07:37.376 --> 00:07:37.875 align:middle line:90%
