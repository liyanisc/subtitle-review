00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Welcome to the eLearning
session Getting

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.130 align:middle line:84%
Started with Ensemble:
Record Mapper - Composite

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.500 align:middle line:90%
and Serial Fields.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.750 align:middle line:84%
The Record Wrapper CSV
Wizard can automatically

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.110 align:middle line:84%
create the field definition
for you from a sample file.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:84%
While this is easier when
the file has a header row,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.680 align:middle line:84%
much repetitive work can be
reduced even without one.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.570 align:middle line:84%
The sample file is identified
along with the record map name.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Identify the record
and field separators

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:90%
and create the record map.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Composite and serial fields
cannot be created using the CSV

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.040 align:middle line:90%
Wizard.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:90%
But they can be added later.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And you may want to change
the field names, especially

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.410 align:middle line:90%
when there is no header row.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:84%
In the Ensemble
Management Portal,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.010 align:middle line:84%
we're going to
create a new record

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:90%
map using the CSV Wizard.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:58.630 align:middle line:84%
So we will click on CSV
Wizard, then select File.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
We will choose the
appropriate text file.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.990 align:middle line:84%
The record map
name is Demo.Name.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
The separator character
will be a semi-colon.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We will keep carriage
return line feed

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.920 align:middle line:90%
as our record terminator.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And we will check Sample
File has header row.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.120 align:middle line:84%
When we click Create
Record Map, the record map

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
will be created for
us automatically.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And the field names are those
that come from the header row.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
Without the header
row, these field names

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.240 align:middle line:84%
would just be Property1,
Property2, and so on.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, the fields
in a fixed-width

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.350 align:middle line:84%
or to delimited file,
are made up of subfields.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.930 align:middle line:84%
In the Record Mapper,
this is represented

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.500 align:middle line:90%
by a composite field.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.220 align:middle line:84%
For a delimted record, you
can specify multiple separator

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:84%
characters that define
the structural hierarchy

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:90%
of the flat file.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:84%
By examining the
Name field, you can

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:84%
see that there is a comma and
a space used as sub separators.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.620 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to add those
two characters to our field

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.240 align:middle line:90%
separator list.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:36.170 align:middle line:84%
First, the comma, and then
the space, which is Escaped.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.180 align:middle line:84%
Once we have done
that, we're going

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.455 align:middle line:84%
to make the Name field
a Composite field.

00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to add
a new composite field, which

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.200 align:middle line:90%
will be LastName.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.825 align:middle line:84%
We will add another
one, GivenName.

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:22.240 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And the GivenName is
going to be a Composite

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.820 align:middle line:84%
so that we can break
apart the first name

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.885 align:middle line:90%
from the middle initial.

00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:45.860 align:middle line:84%
So we will add to the
GivenName, the FirstName,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and add one more
field here, which

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.170 align:middle line:90%
will be the Middle Initial.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.240 align:middle line:84%
And there is our
Composite definition.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Once we save this, we should see
the change in our sample data.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And as you can see,
LastName separated by comma

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.430 align:middle line:84%
from the FirstName,
separated by a space

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.875 align:middle line:84%
from the middle initial,
have been defined.

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:20.579 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.540 align:middle line:84%
Through a naming convention
for the field names,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:84%
serial classes can be created
and embedded in the record map

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.670 align:middle line:90%
class automatically.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.165 align:middle line:84%
This can only be done with
the top level delimiter.

00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:37.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.150 align:middle line:84%
We're going to create two
sets of serial fields,

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:84%
one for the home
address information,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and one for the work
address information.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:59.180 align:middle line:84%
By clicking on HomeCity, we will
change the name to Home.City

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:84%
so that we will be able
to create the Home serial

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.820 align:middle line:84%
class to be embedded directly
into the record map class

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:90%
when we generate.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:28.820 align:middle line:84%
We'll repeat this procedure
for all of the Home fields

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
so that the serial class
will contain four properties.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And we will do the same for
the work address information.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we click
on Generate, we

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:12.440 align:middle line:84%
will see that all
of the classes,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
including the serial
classes for Home and Work,

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:90%
will be generated as well.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And here's our list of
classes that were generated.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.770 align:middle line:84%
There are several pre-built
Business Services,

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
such as EnsLib.RecordMap
.Service.FileService to create

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
an Ensemble message
from a flat file,

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.750 align:middle line:84%
as well as complementary
Business Operations like

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.150 align:middle line:84%
EnsLib.RecordMap
.Operation.FileOperation

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to create a flat file
from and Ensemble message.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:84%
These would be used with the
appropriate inbound or outbound

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.100 align:middle line:90%
adapters.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Simply add the
appropriate record map

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to the Business Service
or Business Operation

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.175 align:middle line:84%
and fill in the
appropriate settings.

00:07:09.175 --> 00:07:12.080 align:middle line:90%


00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
