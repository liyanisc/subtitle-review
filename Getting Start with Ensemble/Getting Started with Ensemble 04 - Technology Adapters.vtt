等等

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.390 align:middle line:84%
As an example, let's look
at the File InboundAdapter
例如，让我们看看文件输入适配器(File InboundAdapter)

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:84%

These are properties
of the adapter class.

When the file adapter is
running in a Business Service,
当文件适配器在一个BS里运行的时候

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.670 align:middle line:84%
it will check the FilePath for
files that match the FileSpec.
它会检查文件路径来寻找符合文件类型的文件

然后把流送给BS里面的

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.090 align:middle line:90%
method of the Business Service.
ProcessInput()

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Upon successful completion
of the Business Service,
一旦这个BS工作成功完成

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
the file is moved to
the ArchiveDirectory,

To include this adapter
in a Business Service,
为了把适配器放到一个BS里

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
I can use the New
Business Service Wizard
我可以用Studio里面的新BS向导

in Studio, which will
create a class like this.
它创建像这样的一个class

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:90%

适配器parameter被指定了

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:84%
as the file inbound adapter
that I've just selected.
正是我刚刚选择的文件输入适配器

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, I need to implement the
OnProcessInput method in order
现在，我们需要实现OnProcessInput()

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
to process, line by line,
the information that
来一行行的处理

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.472 align:middle line:90%
was read into the input stream.
被读到输入流的数据

00:04:34.472 --> 00:04:38.290 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Other Inbound Adapters, such as
the FTP adapter, email adapter,
其他输入适配器，比如FTP适配器，email适配器

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.860 align:middle line:84%
or SQL adapter behave
in much the same way,
或者SQL适配器，以差不多相同的方式工作

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
although the settings
available are different.
虽然要做的设置项目不同

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:84%
The TCP and HTTP adapters
are slightly different
TCP和HTTP适配器有一点不同

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and open a socket and listen for
input continually, rather than
它们是打开一个socket，持续的监听输入

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.730 align:middle line:90%
polling at intervals.
而不是以一个时间间隔做轮询，

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:84%
But the essential
use is the same.
但基本的使用是相同的。

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.770 align:middle line:84%
Now we will look at
Outbound Adapters, which are
现在我们看看输出适配器，他们是被

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.820 align:middle line:90%
called by Business Operations.
BO调用的

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.190 align:middle line:84%
In a Business Operation,
the property ADAPTER
在BO里，property ADAPTER

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
holds an object reference
to the adapter object
保存一个到适配器对象的对象reference

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.550 align:middle line:84%
so you can call methods or
set properties of the adapter.
由此你可以调用methods，或者设置这个适配器的property

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
Normally, the Outbound Adapter
exposes a few simple methods
一般说，输出适配器暴露一些简单的methods

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:84%
to make it easy to
call the adapter.
使调用这个适配器容易

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at an example
of a Business Operation
让我们看一个BO的例子

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.070 align:middle line:90%
using the SQL Outbound Adapter.
其中用了SQL输出适配器

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.920 align:middle line:84%
So we will open
Business Operations,
让我们打开BO

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:90%
eLearning, SQLOperation.
eLearning, SQLOperation.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
When using the Business
Operation Wizard,
当使用BO向导

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
you define the adapter to
be used for this Business
你定义了这个BO用的适配器

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.820 align:middle line:84%
Operation, and that value
becomes the ADAPTER property.
其中值是适配器的property

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.290 align:middle line:84%
That makes coding the
Business Operation much easier
这使得BO的代码编写更容易

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.260 align:middle line:84%
since the adapter methods and
properties are now exposed
因为适配器methods和properties现在都暴露

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.220 align:middle line:90%
to the Business Operation.
给BO

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:84%
I can set properties
of the adapter.
我可以设置这个适配器的properties

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
For example, in
my OnInit method,
比如，在我的 OnInit()

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I have set the timeout in
the Statement,Attrs property.
我在Adapter.StatementAttrs里设置了超时时长

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.180 align:middle line:84%
The main properties
of each adapter
每个适配器主要的properties

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
are exposed through
the configuration
被暴露出来，通过产品的

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:90%
page of the Production.
配置页

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So the values can be set either
in the configuration item,
所以值可以设置在配置项里， 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.630 align:middle line:84%
or they can be set in the
Business Operation code.
或者设置在BO程序代码里

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.450 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:41.290 align:middle line:84%
The MessageMap defines
the post-message method
MessageMap定义了收到消息后的method

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
for StringRequest messages
that are sent to this Business
这里消息是指发给BO的StringRequest消息

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:90%
Operation.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:53.060 align:middle line:84%
In this case, SQL
inserts the text content
在这个例子里， SQL插入了StringRequest的文本内容

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.910 align:middle line:84%
of my StringRequest message
into one column and the time
到一栏里，而时间

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:90%
and date into another column.
和日期到另一栏

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:84%
The SQL Outbound
Adapter also has methods
SQL输出适配器还拥有methods

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.710 align:middle line:90%
to execute queries and updates.
来执行查询和更新

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.020 align:middle line:84%
When working with
any adapter, you
当使用任何适配器的时候

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.490 align:middle line:84%
will find the online class
reference in our documentation
你可以找到在线文档

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to be very useful for seeing
what methods and properties are
对发现(适配器)都提供什么property和method

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:90%
available.
非常有用

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.410 align:middle line:84%
If we take a look
at the configuration
如果我们看一下产品配置页面

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:29.720 align:middle line:84%
page of a Production, we can
add the SQL Business Operation
我们可以加入SQL BO

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:84%
to the Production, simply
selecting it from the list,
到产品，简单的从列表里面选择它

giving it a name, making
sure it's enabled so that it

00:07:47.726 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.510 align:middle line:84%
If we take a look
at this operation,
如果你看一下这个BO

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:84%
you can see in the
Settings the adapter class
你可以在Setting里看到正在使用的Adapter class

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:84%
that's being utilized, the class
for the Business Operation,
还有BO的class 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:12.250 align:middle line:84%
as well as information that
would be required for a SQL
还包括SQL连接需要的信息

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
